# 2024-04-24 – Empire of the Ghouls

## Characters

- Bruno (PP 15) – There are many layers to the dark gods worshipped by the ghouls – Akma Apophis is the oldest of them.
- Durrim (PP 20) – Akma Apophis may be a mask of Hel – or vice versa. The ghouls worshipped both as separate gods yet both domains cross over.
- HB (PP 18) – Camazotz loves the strife of the ghouls and their gods. Let them burn.
- Ved Pinion (PP 19) – To see Ved Ivis in action is to see what Pinion might have become. Pinion had a whole life without murder. Ivis has had no such life.
- Verci (PP ) – To have hunted the Shoggoth and destroyed it is amazing. But you sense something else here too.
- Wynasia (PP 11) – Never have you been in the heart of a den of such evil in your life. This whole cavern could collapse and the world would be better for it.
